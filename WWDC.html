          <h4>Background</h4>
            <p><i>Spring 2019</i></p>
          <p> During Spring of 2019, I became aware of the WWDC scholarship challenge. THe challenge required that, over the course of about a month, students build a short, 3-minute max visual experience using Apple's Swift Playgrounds platform. The winners would then be sponsored to attend Apple's annual tech conference WWDC. While I did not win a scholarship, this project was still a lot of fun to work and helped familiarize myself with the Swift programming language. </p>

    <h4>Design</h4>
      <ul>


        <p>Parameters:</p><li>Interaction parameters immediately evident to users</li><li>Highlights capabilities of a specific Swift Library</li><li>Immediately engaging visuals</li><li>Creative and fun conceit</li>


        <p>Solution:</p>
          <li>Concept:
            <ul>
              <li>Users drag and drop construction workers onto an invisible isometric grid</li>
              <li>Construction workers construct a one-story building</li>
              <li>As more buildings are constructed, buildings begin to evolve and form a bustling, randomly generated city on screen</li>

            </ul>

          </li>
          <li>Hand-drawn frames animated using SpriteKit</li>
          <li>Used randomly timers to spawn cars, planes and swamp monsters around growing city</li>
          <li>Devloped a snap to grid functionality to allow users to drop workers onto unoccupied sections of the city's isometric grid</li>
