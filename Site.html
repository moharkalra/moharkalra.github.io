          <h4>Background</h4>
            <p><i>Winter 2017, Winter 2018</i></p>
          <p>As I have had more time and opportunity to pursue personal projects of various kinds in college, I realized that it may be valuable to have a site to post all of them - from art to my research work.</p>
      </div>
      </div>

    <div class = "six columns">
      <div class = "me">
        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <p>To build a personal website from scratch, as both a design and technical challenge. Further, it needed to function as a portfolio, displaying information about myself and my projects in as coherent, concise and aesthetically pleasing a manner as possible. The following documents my process through two iterations of this website.</p>

          <h4>My First Design</h4>
            <ul>
              <p>Target Users</p>

              <li>Individuals interested in surveying my art practice</li>
              <li>Individuals interested in my technical experience for employment/career opportunities</li>
              <p>Parameters:</p>
              <li>Include sections for comics, research projects, technical projects and personal information</li>
              <li>Concise descriptions of projects to retain visitors’ attention</li>
              <li>Capacity to navigate easily from page to page</li>
              <li>All information easily and efficiently accessible from home page</li>
              <li>Aesthetically pleasing without being flashy</li>
              <li>Allow various projects on display to shine without the web design drawing too much attention to itself</li>
              <li>Offer a quick and seamless user experience for users who do not have the time to delve deep into the site</li>
              <li>Format to add new projects easily without redesigning entire site</li>


              <div class = "sec">
                <p>Initial Website Layout:</p>

                <img class = "pic" src="Layout1.png" style = "width:90%; height: auto; ">

              </div>
              <p>Solution:</p>
              <li>Used html, css, javascript and heavily modified skeleton.css column framework to build this website.</li>
              <li>Designed one home page with scrolling navigation bar and pages for each project</li>
              <li>Split home page into four sections: About me, technical projects, art projects and contact information</li>
              <li>Modular display of projects allows for easy addition of new projects to the home page</li>
              <li>Drew banner on home page to augment the page’s design.</li>
              <li>Muted color scheme to focus most of user attention on my projects</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>January 2019 Re-Design</h4>
              <ul>
                <p>Flaws with previous iteration</p>
                <li>Design was bland and unnmemorable</li>
                <li>Did little to convey my character as a creator</li>
                <li>Technical and artistic projects did not cohere with one another well</li>

                <p>Target Users</p>

                <li>Individuals interested in surveying my art practice</li>
                <li>Creative technologists interested in my work</li>

                <p>Parameters:</p>
                <li>Artistically engaging and memorable site design without being overwhelming</li>
                <li>Convey a sense of my own somewhat offbeat and quirky artistic inclinations without being tacky</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Convey a sense of wonder and curiousity towards the world around me - conveyed through both tech and art</li>
                    <li>Add a sense of movement and energy to the web design to reflect the affective, kinetic work I'm interested in making</li>
                  </ul>
                <li>Use space in website in a more engaging manner</li>
                <li>Maintain easy and intuitive access to content</li>
                <li>Make the experience of interacting with my website remarkable in itself</li>
                <li>The website's design must be an artistic product of its own</li>
                <li>Must visually bridge the gap between my technical and artistic passions</li>

                <div class = "sec">
                  <p>Current Website Illustrations:</p>

                  <img class = "pic" src="Banner.gif" style = "width:90%; height: auto; ">
                  <img class = "pic" src="About3.gif" style = "width:90%; height: auto; ">
                  <img class = "pic" src="css/SolderingIron2.jpg" style = "width:90%; height: auto; ">
                  <img class = "pic" src="css/Artsy2.jpg" style = "width:90%; height: auto; ">
                  <img class = "pic" src="contact.gif" style = "width:90%; height: auto; ">

                <div class = "sec">
                  <p>Current Website Layout:</p>

                  <img class = "pic" src="Layout2.png" style = "width:90%; height: auto; ">

                </div>
                <p>Solution:</p>
                <li>Selected a bright color scheme of blue, magenta, purple, orange, bright yellow and white, harkening back to vintage pop culture color schemes</li>
                <li>Replaced banners with eye-catching animations intended to add a dynamism to the front page</li>
                <li>Reorganized front page projects and sections overall into horizontal tiers, creating a repeated rhythm to the viewing experience</li>
                <li>Replaced white space with wallpaper-esque background to emulate DIY zine patterns</li>
                <li>Illustrations depict me interacting with the world around me, creating a creative persona through the imagery</li>
                <li>Emphasis on sensation and color underlines the inspirations that lead me in my artistic and my technical endeavors</li>
                <li>Refrain from using animations in "Tech" and "Art" sections to ensure that projects are user's focus</li>
                <li>Bookend front page with animated gifs to provide continuity to viewing experience from beginning to end</li>
              </ul>
