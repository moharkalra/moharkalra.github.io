          <h4>Background</h4>
            <p><i>Winter 2018</i></p>
          <p>Ratrock is the student arts advocacy group on Columbia's campus. We publish the work of student artists, publish interviews for each artist and organize gallery shows of featured artists' work. Our goal is to offer students a stage upon which to present their art. I recently joined Ratrock as their Webmaster and have been tasked with redesigning their squarespace website.</p>

      <div class = "me">
        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <p>To reorganize and redesign Ratrock's website to display their content in the most accesible and intuitive manner possible while highlighting Ratrock's values as an organization. </p>

        <h4>Initial Web Design</h4>
        <div class = "sec">
          <p>Ratrock Front Page Layout before I joined:</p>

          <img class = "pic" src="OldRatrock.png" style = "width:90%; height: auto; ">

        </div>
          <ul>
            <p>Content</p>
            <li>"Faces" pages showcasing the work of four selected featured artists for each month since Ratrock's inception</li>
            <li>"Yearbook" pages displaying in Issuu the print copies of Ratrock's "yearbooks" summarizing "Faces" pages</li>
            <li>"About" pages with club information</li>
            <li>"Happenings" page with a calendar describing arts on campus</li>
            <li>"Contact and Apply" pages with information for applicants</li>
            <li>Front Page with a blog displaying all published interviews and gallery announcements for featured artists</li>
            <p>Front Page Design</p>
            <li>Navigation bar to reach each of pages described above</li>
            <li>Sidebar with most recent posts from Ratrock's Instagram</li>
            <li>Blog containing interviews of featured artists and Call-To-Artist Show announcements</li>
            <li>Header containing a summary of the most recent blog posts</li>
            <p>Design Issues</p>
            <li>Blog posts disorganized and difficult to navigate</li>
            <li>Overwhelming level of content on front page, as blog is infinitely scrollable</li>
            <li>Frontpage only focuses on interviews and blog posts without leading users to any other content on website</li>
            <li>Redundant header summary of blog posts on front page</li>
            <li>Yearbook and Faces content overlaps unnecessarily</li>
            <li>Little hierarchy to information presented</li>
            <li>Interviews in blog posts are not linked to the Faces pages of their respective artists</li>

          <h4>Design</h4>
            <ul>
              <p>Ratrock Design Priorities</p>
              <li>Emphasis on featured artists and their artwork primarily</li>
              <li>Ratrock gallery shows must be highlighted</li>
              <li>Interviews are secondary to the featured artists they center on</li>
              <p>Target Users</p>
              <li>Students interested in the arts at Columbia</li>
              <li>Established professionals interested in content about specific featured artists</li>
              <p>Parameters:</p>
              <li>Use preset Squarespace Avenue Template blocks to ensure that future Ratrock content creators can easily modify site</li>
              <li>Clear hierarchy of information focusing on featured artists on front page to guide user experience</li>
              <li>Little redundancy in content</li>
              <li>Aesthetically pleasing and easily digestible design</li>
              <li>Reflect Ratrock design priorities</li>


              <div class = "sec">
                <p>Redesigned Front Page Mock-up</p>

                <img class = "pic" src="NewRatrock.png" style = "width:90%; height: auto">

              </div>

              <p>Solution:</p>
              <li>Reorganize the frontpage as follows:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Header containing the current month's faces and a slideshow showcasing their art</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Ensures that artists' face and persona is linked to artwork</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>Underneath, display summary of posts on a separate interviews page</li>
                  <li>Sidebar containing links to yearbooks and summaries of upcoming events/upcoming Ratrock Call-to-Artist shows</li>
                  <li>End page with posts from Ratrock Instagram, bookending user experience with images of artists and their art</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Create separate blog containing artist interviews - accessible from front page, from each individual artist's "Faces" page and from navbar </li>
              <li>Combine Happenings page and Ratrock gallery announcements into one Events page - accessible from front page and navbar</li>
              <li>Combine Yearbook and Faces pages so each yearbook page links to the faces for each constituent month</li>
              <li>Added search functionality to navbar</li>

            </ul>
